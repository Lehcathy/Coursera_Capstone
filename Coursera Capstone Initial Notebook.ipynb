    "Being the most populous city in the United States, New York is home to a plethora of diverse cultures. Over time the city has seen the growth of communities with defined geographic boundaries, many of which are tied to ethnic groups as seen in \"Little Italy\" or \"Chinatown\". These neighbourhoods live side by side to one another and thus see a high degree of inter-mixing and shared traditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses, espcially local ones, are met with great potential and opportunity in New York due to the city's large, yet close-knit communities. The success of the business itself will depend largely on its location as there needs to be a balance of competition and demand from the surrounding area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem that this report will be catering to is a group of stakeholders interested in opening a Vietnamese restaurant in New York City. We will aim to find the optimal location and to do so we must consider areas that have low competition yet high demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Competition comes from restaurants which also serve Vietnamese or similar cuisines. Demand can be gauged by the density of restaurants in the area, specifically ones that serve opposing cuisines, as we will want a location with high foot traffic to draw people into our business. Competition with other Vietnamese restaurants can be helpful to some extent in bringing in customers to the area, but for this project we will eliminate the risk by avoiding other Vietnamese restaurants."

By passing specific parameters for Vietnamese or similar cuisines we can see the level of competition in these areas as well. \n",
